## Do this on Fox cloud

First you should clone this GitHub repo, or your personal copy of the repo if you created one. Navigate to your home directory (simply type `cd`) and then type `git clone https://github.com/jonbra/BIOS-IN5410.git` (or the link to your copy). Then navigate inside the `BIOS-IN5410` directory and do the exercise from there. If you can't use Git then you need to make sure to get the data files onto the server some other way (using `scp` for instance).  

### Part 1
- Type `module load R/4.2.1-foss-2022a`
- Use your favorite text editor (e.g. Nano or vim) to create a file with the following content:
```{r}
my_files <- list.files()
print(my_files)
```
- Save the file as *my_first_Rscript.R*
- Run the script in R by typing `Rscript my_first_Rscript.R`  
 
You should see a list of files printed to the screen. Type the `ls` command in the terminal and check that it prints the same files.
Congratulations! You have just created your first R script!

### Part 2
- Create another file called *my_second_Rscript.R* with the contents:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# NB! We assume here that you cloned the GitHub repo to your home directory
df <- read_csv("~/BIOS-IN5410/data/data_file_1.csv")
# Plot gene length vs. count
pdf(file = "gene_length_vs_count.pdf") # This tells R that you want to make a pdf file, and what to call it
plot(df$length, df$count) # Make the plot
dev.off() # And save the plot
```
Run the script with `Rscript my_second_Rscript.R`. You should see the output of the messages when loading tidyverse, the output or reading the csv files as well as somehting like "null device 1" (this is from the pdf-plotting). In addition there should now be a new pdf file in your home directory (if not, check carefully the filepaths in the R script and compare with your directory structure on Fox). Download the pdf file to your local computer and open it.

### Part 3
If you for example want to repeat the commands in *my_second_Rscript.R* on a different data file, or save the pdf with a different file name, you have to open and change the script every time. But it's also possible to pass "arguments" when running the R script that allows you to create a more flexible script that can do different operations every time.
- Copy *my_second_Rscript.R* to a new file called *my_third_Rscript.R* using the Unix `cp` command.
- Change the contents to this:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
args <- commandArgs(trailingOnly=TRUE) # This captures whatever you type on the command line
df <- read_csv("~/BIOS-IN5410/data/data_file_1.csv") # Make sure the file path is correct
# Create an object that stores the file name
name <- args[1]
# Plot gene length vs. count
pdf(file = name)
plot(df$length, df$count)
dev.off()
```
If you run the script like this: `Rscript my_third_Rscript.R new_name.pdf`, `args[1]` takes whatever is written after the script name (i.e. the first argument) and passes it as a text string into the object `name`. 

### Part 4
Can you modify the script so that it takes a second argument that tells R which data file to read and store in `df`?
